## What is VAGLookup
VAGLookup is a frontend-only vehicle lookup tool made **specifically** for Volkswagen Group vehicles.
It allows the owners (even future ones!) and enthusiasts to retrieve essential vehicle information using a VIN or a Greek license plate, without requiring dealer access or paid services.

## VAGLookup is for everyone
I personally believe access to basic vehicle information should not be limited to dealers, paid platforms and closed systems.
Because of this, **VAGLookup is made for everyone!**

### For the buyer
- Retrieve and verify the vehicle’s VIN, allowing the use of third-party services (e.g. accident history or insurance databases)
- Verify whether the vehicle is officially registered in Greece or imported
- Ensure all safety-related recalls have been carried out before buying
- Confirm the exact model, trim and equipment of the vehicle
- View registration date information

### For the owner
- Spot open recalls as soon as they become available
- Ensure spare parts fitment, using factory equipment (PR) codes

### For the mechanic
- View detailed vehicle information on the go
- Get insight on pending & completed recalls which might affect safety and/or scope of repair
- Full access to PR codes & component codings, allowing easy repairs and control module replacement

### For the privacy-conscious
- Free & open source
- Based on official API endpoints
- Client-side architecture ensures no data leaves your browser

## [TODO] How it works
VAGLookup works as a data aggregator. It combines data from multiple sources into a single, user-friendly layout, allowing users to quickly verify essential vehicle details without relying on a backend server.

VAGLookup uses publicly reachable API endpoints for data aggregation and all the requests are handled by the client. No vehicle-related data is stored, logged, or transmitted to any external server.
No private, authenticated, or dealer-restricted systems are accessed.
